# REVLoot-Front-End

## Project Description
RevLoot supports a larger strategic framework to enable other developers, designers, and programmers to develop and add new functions/enhancements. Its primary design implements an e-commerce application for the company Revature.  Revloot provides users the ability to view all products and services promoted by the company for purchase.  Ranging from $0.00 and up, shoppers can add services/products to their shopping cart, edit the shopping cart as well as remove items from the cart.  Items can be added in multiple quantities, from various categories all simultaneously.  

Revloot provides users the ability to set up an account, and store login details which can be modified or deleted by the user at any time.  Setup is simple, as password hashing is enabled, which allows the user to focus on tailoring their profile for individuality or as a company.  The application provides the user a pleasurable shopping experience while embodying the company’s slogan **“Designed for ease. Loved for style”.
